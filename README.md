This is a demo project. In this project I have tried to make to create a site with information of the English Premier league football. The site will be authenticated and will have users to login in order to see the required information.

Tech Stack use :- HTML,CSS,JavaScript,Git.

Creds to use of log in :-
Email :- user1@gmail.com;
Password :- User0001;

SiteFlow :-
This is an authenticated site--- meaning users would need to login to access the site in full action.After the user logs in, the user can see details of other pages and information about the league.
Site breakdown:
The header have the following details:
1.Logo
2.Navigation
1.Home
2.Clubs List
3.Match Details
3.Logout Option

For footer:
1.Logo
2.Navigation
3.Social Links
4.Copyright

The site have following pages:

1.Login Page: Login form which the user needs to submit to access the platform.The creds used for login are static.After login, the user can't be access the login page, and if the user reloads the page, the user still be logged in.Before login users can not access any other page other than login page.logout option is provided on the site.Local storage is used for authenticating whether user is logged in or not.

2.HomePage: This page have details of the EPL(English Premier League). Like the Information of the league, history etc.

3.Club List: This page have a dropdown of all the clubs of the league.Once the club is selected, it will show the 5 results of that particular team. On every click 5 results will be added more to the result list and once the all the results are displayed the show more button will disappear.

4.Match Details: This page have a dropdown of the Matchday(Week when matches happen).When the matchday is selected, corresponding matches results will be displayed.
The score of the team is displayed where the team name is clickable and if user click on any of the team name it will take user to the club list page with that club selected in the dropdown list and 5 results will be displayed of that particular team.Also, the show more functionality for the club list page will remain the same even when I navigate from this page.

Thank you.
